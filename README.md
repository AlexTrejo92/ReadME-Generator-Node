To use this application you should have Node.Js installed on your terminal and use NPM I to install inquirer library and FS library.

## Usage

After installing the proper libraries (inquirer & fs) make sure to use the node index.js commmand to run the application on the terminal. You will be presented a series of questions, answer them and after answering all of the questions, your readme file will be created on the DEST (destination) folder.
